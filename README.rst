Works with
==========

* Plone 4

Installation
============

If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``rohberg.doorman`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

[buildout]
...
eggs =
    ...
    rohberg.doorman
    
* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::

[instance]
recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
...
zcml =
    rohberg.doorman
     
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

$ ./bin/buildout

     
You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.

Then open the "Security" control panel of your Plone site. A new field lets you 
define your custom password policy via regular expressions.


Password Policy
=============================

As long as no custom policy is configured, default policy as defined in this package is effective. You can review and edit the effective password policy on security control panel.

Password Duration
============================

If an expiration of password is defined in security control panel and user has not reset his password during defined expiration time reset password form is presented to user after login attempt which is rejected.
